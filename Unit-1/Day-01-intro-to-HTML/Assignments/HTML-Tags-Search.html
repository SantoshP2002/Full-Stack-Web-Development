    <!-- b Tag -->
    <h1>b Tag: The Bring Attention To element</h1>
    <p>The <b>b</b> HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <b>b</b> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <strong>strong</strong> element.</p>

    <!-- i Tag -->
    <h1>i Tag : The Idiomatic Text element</h1>
    <p>The <i>i</i> HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i>i</i> naming of this element.</p>


    <!-- u Tag -->
    <h1>u Tag: The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element</h1>
    <p>The <u>u</u> HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS.</p>


    <!-- select Tag -->
    <h1>select Tag: The HTML Select element</h1>
    <p>The <select>select</select> HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.</p>




    <!-- button Tag -->
    <h1>button Tag: The Button element</h1>
    <p>The <button>button</button> HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then performs an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.

        By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.</p>




    <!-- hr Tag -->
    <h1>hr Tag: The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element</h1>
    <p>The <b>hr</b> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.<hr></p>





    <!-- br Tag -->
    <h1>br Tag: The Line Break element</h1>
    <p>The <b>br</b> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return).<br> It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.</p>
